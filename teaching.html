                    <p>
                        My teaching philosophy centers on making economics accessible and relevant to students from diverse 
                        backgrounds. I believe that effective economics education should combine rigorous theoretical 
                        foundations with real-world applications that help students understand how economic principles 
                        shape policy decisions and everyday life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strive to create an inclusive classroom environment where students feel comfortable asking questions 
                        and engaging in critical thinking. I use a variety of teaching methods, including interactive lectures, 
                        group discussions, empirical exercises, and case studies, to accommodate different learning styles 
                        and keep students engaged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Particularly in my econometrics and research methods courses, I emphasize hands-on learning with 
                        statistical software and real data. I believe that students learn best when they can immediately 
                        apply theoretical concepts to practical problems and see the relevance of what they're learning 
                        to current policy debates and research questions.
